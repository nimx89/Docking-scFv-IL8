# Docking of anti-IL8 scFv to IL8

## Note on protein models

The model for the anti-IL8 scFv (anti-interleukin-8) (single-chain variable fragment) is taken from our [scFv-Modelling](https://github.com/iGEMIISc/scFv-Modelling) repository. In particular, we have chosen the ColabFold model generated with PDB70. We have used ColabFold for a graphic processing unit for folding proteins in a 3-Dimensional format. It has a GDT_TS (Global distance Test) score of 92.4% . This is a rating of the comparision of protein structures with well known amino acid sequences. ColabFold performs a MMseqs-2 based homology search server to find the template of the protein.

Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a chemokine produced by various immune cell types, such as macrophages and monocytes. This acts as a mediator of inflammation in the tissues and a potent angiogenic factor. It attracts various kinds of phagocytic cells such as neutrophils, basophils and T-cells to stimulate the phagocytosis of cells and promote angiogenesis.
Being a chemokine ,  it promotes the immune cell migration for the phagocytosis. These belong to a set of monoclonal antibodies which have become a modern class of medicines used for treating various diseases such as cancer , cardiovascular and inflammation diseases.
The scFv antibody fragments consist of variable regions of heavy (VH) and light chain (VL) of full antibodies that are joined by a linker sequence.

The model for IL8 is taken from the [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2IL8) (PDB ID: 2IL8). This PDB file consists of 30 models, each with a different conformation of IL8 in a 3D structure. We have chosen the first model for our docking.

## Global Range Molecular Matching (GRAMM)

GRAMM is a docking web server that maps the intermolecular energy landscape by predicting a spectrum of docking poses corresponding to stable (deep energy minima) and transient (shallow minima) protein interactions. We used the anti-IL8 scFv as the receptor and IL8 as the ligand.

### Free Docking

In a free docking algorithm, a large number of conformations of the two proteins are evaluated to minimize the energy of their interaction.

### Template-based Docking

In the template-based method, a search is made from the PDB to identify heterodimer templates for our target. Then, homology modeling is used to map the target sequence onto the template structure.

We will be taking the top models from both the free docking and template-based docking methods for further analysis. It should be noted that these can not be directly compared as the free docking method results are expressed in terms of shape complementarity while the template-based docking method results are expressed in terms of AACE18 (atomic contact energy) scores.

## Analysis of Docking Results using PRODIGY

PRODIGY (PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction) is a web server for predicting the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes. We used this tool to analyze the docking results obtained from GRAMM.

| Method |  Predicted Binding Affinity <br> $\Delta G$ in $\text{kcal}~\text{mol}^{-1}$ | Predicted Dissociation Constant <br> $K_d$ in $\text{M}$ at $36 \degree\text{C}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Free Docking | $-16.5$ | $2.2 \times 10^{-12}$ |
| Template-based Docking | $-7.4$ | $6.3 \times 10^{-6}$ |

The calculations are done for $36 \degree\text{C}$ as this is the temperature at which our antibody will interact with IL8 in the human peritoneum*. It can be seen that free docking has provided a much more favorable binding affinity and dissociation constant than template-based docking. This suggests that the free docking could access a more stable conformation of the complex, and thus is more likely to be closer to the actual binding conformation.

Detailed results are available in the `PRODIGY` directory.
